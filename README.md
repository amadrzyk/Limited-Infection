 One thing we really need is a real-world visualization. Types of users we have: 
 *Single users with absolutely no connections (degree = 0) 
 	*These can be infected immediately
 *Clusters of users with some connections (degree = 1-20?)
 	*Might want to try visualizing these clusters
 	*They can be completely separate (in which case you can infect the whole group)
 *If there is only one linkage between someone in one group and another, 
 we can risk that linkage with the discrepancy in two sites
